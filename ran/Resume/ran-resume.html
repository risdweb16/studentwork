		<li>As the co-founder and creative director of this company I established it with geek musician Wang Bolong in 2013 which
is dedicated to colleting music data. We’ve done some excellent work, such as laying the special carpet in livehouse
MAO in Beijing. During the bands playing the carpet can collect different audience’s feet jump frequency and
amplitude which could reflect the mood of the audience. Also we made a special wastepaper basket for songwriters
which could generate rhyming words from the trash. The company has been reported by Economic Information Daily,
Beijing International Design Week and Pingwest, and got investment from the Baidu Cloud Angel funds.</li>
