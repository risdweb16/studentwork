	<p>As far back as I can remember, I have been a bold and innovative person.I have been more interested
in the design and functionality of things. Instead of fawning over musicians, I prefer analyzing the
data of their audiences' reaction to their live performance. I prefer to keep up with renovations
around the world, such as tech and inventions emerging on Kickstarter. I also like to be hands on
when solving problems, like making an alarm system on my bag after losing three cell phones. My
more hobby-like passions include traveling, cooking, and some sports. I've been to many European
countries, and wrote and published my travel journal on a travel website. Since I enjoy Chinese,
Western, and Japanese cuisine, I've learned some dishes from all three categories. As for sports, I
like the more adrenaline inducing snowboarding, as well as much calmer activities like archery.</p>

        	As the co-founder and creative director of this company I established it with geek musician Wang Bolong in 2013 which is dedicated to colleting music data. We’ve done some excellent work, such as laying the special carpet in livehouse MAO in Beijing. During the bands playing the carpet can collect different audience’s feet jump frequency and amplitude which could reflect the mood of the audience. Also we made a special wastepaper basket for songwriters which could generate rhyming words from the trash. The company has been reported by Economic Information Daily, Beijing International Design Week and Pingwest, and got investment from the Baidu Cloud Angel funds.   </td>

I got the internship opportunity to work there with Professor Gu Xueyong who is now teaching at Tsinghua University. He allowed me to be independently in charge of multiple projects and I was mainly responsible for the work related to design, like the logo robot design and collaborative design with processing. Also once I was in charge of the advertising design work of Zha Kexin’ s lecture tour in campus who is a famous bilingual hostess, sin ger-songwriter and speaker in China. </td>
