1. Create a GitHub account by going to github.com
2. Download GitHub for Mac (or PC) but you must have OSX 10.8 or later. To check what OSX Version you have go to the Apple in the top left of your screen and click "About This Mac". It should say version 10.X.X and need to be 10.8 or above. Let me know if you don't have 10.8.
3. Email me (motsuka@risd.edu) your username so I can add you to the team for our site.
4. Once added, clone the gh-pages repository to your desktop version. There is a button in the far right column.
5. Test out committing (command+return) and syncing (command+s) on the index.html file in the folder with your name on it.
