  <h1 class="title">BOOTY POP</h1>
  <p>Sex Positive // 18+ // Industrial Design</p>

  <p>Before the end of my fall semester I decided to take a step into the adult toy industry. As someone who studies industrial design I feel that the production and design of adult pleasure products isn’t spoken about enough. This isn’t exactly surprising, considering that the use of such products is personal, and most often behind closed doors. Sex in itself can be considered a taboo topic for some, so understandably the topic of sex toys leaves many people uncomfortable and silent. That all being said, carved dildos go back to Paleolithic times (oldest known) and like it or not these “pleasure products” haven’t left us since.
  </p>

  <p>The Booty Pop is a butt plug designed for first time users. The approachable form, fun colors, appropriate sizing make the Booty Pop the perfect starting point for anyone.

      <p>Using the wooden lathe I turned some different forms out of wood (Cherry to be specific). It was important for me to explore different options. Once I decided on a piece it was sanded down and primed. Wood putty was used to fill some of the bigger holes, and did a final coat after the primer in Montana spray paint.  There couldn’t be any bumps or imperfections in the master, because that would be reflected in the mold. Once the master was the desired smoothness it was mounted onto a board and prepped for the mold making process.</p>

      <p>Before going ahead and pouring my final silicone toy, I needed to do a plaster test. This was a good way to make sure the mold was working, without wasting any silicone.</p>
 
      <p>After learning the test was sucessful, I could move on and make my silicone Booty Pops.</p>

      <p>The Booty Pop then went into its user testing phase. A select group of people volunteered and had been selected to use this product for the first time.</p>
      <p>After initial user testing some flaws were found in the general shape. A redesign was in order. Adjustments include a more narrow body and a longer stem. These changes make the product more comfortable during use.</p>
