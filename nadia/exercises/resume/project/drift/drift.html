      <h2>PROCESS</h2>
      <p>
        Looking at my surroundings was a great source of inspiration. The industrial feel of the city really drove the overall design. The abandoned and graffitied walls of Providence reflect a rebellious lifestyle full of mischief and good times. This is where the rebels sneak off to when the sun starts to set.
      </P>

        This drift trike isn’t for the weak hearted. It is for lovers of extreme sports, for riders who aren’t afraid of getting a little scabbed up in the process.

      <p>
        I made a full scale drawing in order to let myself see everything in proportion. This also let me see how everything would come together in the final product. I used this drawing throughout my making process.

        All the the tubing had to be fishmouthed to allow for good connection points. Other smaller parts also had to be machined using both the laythe and  Bridgeport. This also meant that a variety of jigs had to be set up to allow for proper cuts to be made.
      </p>
      <p>
        I primarily used 1.5 inch steel tubing and a variety of steel stock.

        A jig was created to assist in making accurate welds. The board allows for multiple set ups using U clamps and counter sunk holes.

      <p>
        With the help of Will Reeves, the shop technician, the trike was welded together.

        Users, tested the trike to make sure seating was well positioned. This also helped with consideration for break placement.

        The final trike was powder coated and assembled with all necessary attachments.
