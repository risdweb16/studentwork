          In the year 2016 different robots have been developed to help civilians in struggling communities. Robots like Ricky are in charge of general maintenance and video surveillance.  They do everything they can to keep things around them running smoothly. Using voice recognition software people on the streets can ask Ricky questions about the news or have him help carry groceries into their home. At other times these robots can be seen picking up trash, fixing broken items, and caring for those in need.

      <p>
          Now you can take a miniature version of Ricky the robot home with you. With over 30 adjustable parts and light up features, you are in for an endless amount of fun.
