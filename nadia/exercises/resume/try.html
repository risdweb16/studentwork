	<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
    Hey there!
    </p>

    <p>
        My name is Nadia and I am a first generation, Russian, creative mind  from California with a background in sculpture, graphic design, and product design.
    </p> 


<p>
    I am currently finishing up my last semester at the Rhode Island School of Design as an Industrial Designer (class of ‘16). The last four years have taught me an endless array of skills that have helped me in producing what my portfolio is today. These projects took blood, sweat, and tears and I would give an arm and a leg too, if only I could regenerate. Oh well . . . maybe in the future?
</p>

<p>
    When I’m not working on my own projects I am a monitor for both the Metal Shop and CAD Lab in the Industrial Design Department at RISD. This means I am trusted to watch over and help out other student as they spend any free time they wish they had in the shops. I’ve also spent a summer as a Ceramics intern for the HAAS Brother in Los Angeles
</p>


<p>
    It’s been a pretty wild ride so far but now I’m ready to see what I can do next. I want more! 
</p>

<p>
    So get let's get in touch and make some cool things happen.
